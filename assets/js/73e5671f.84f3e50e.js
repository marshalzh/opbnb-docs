The DA data is a compressed representation of the transactions on L2, which can be used to reconstruct the world state of L2 if needed. However, this process is expensive and time-consuming, so it is not done for every withdrawal. Instead, you need to submit a proof withdrawal, which is a cryptographic proof that your transaction on L2 matches the world state of L2 at a certain point in time.
