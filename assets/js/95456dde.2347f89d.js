Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n      string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",\n      "firstName": <string>,\n      "lastName": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",\n      "value": "1.212s"\n    }'}}}}}}}},parameters:[{name:"granter",description:"granter is the address of the user granting an allowance of their funds.",in:"path",required:!0,schema:{type:"string"}},{name:"grantee",description:"grantee is the address of the user being granted an allowance of another user's funds.",in:"path",required:!0,schema:{type:"string"}}],tags:["Query"],description:"Allowance returns fee granted to the grantee by the granter.",method:"get",path:"/cosmos/feegrant/v1beta1/allowance/{granter}/{grantee}",info:{title:"Greenfield - gRPC Gateway docs",description:"A REST interface for state queries",version:"1.0.0"},postman:{name:"Allowance returns fee granted to the grantee by the granter.",description:{type:"text/plain"},url:{path:["cosmos","feegrant","v1beta1","allowance",":granter",":grantee"],host:["{{baseUrl}}"],query:[],variable:[{disabled:!1,description:{content:"(Required) granter is the address of the user granting an allowance of their funds.",type:"text/plain"},type:"any",value:"",key:"granter"},{disabled:!1,description:{content:"(Required) grantee is the address of the user being granted an allowance of another user's funds.",type:"text/plain"},type:"any",value:"",key:"grantee"}]},header:[{key:"Accept",value:"*/*"}],method:"GET"}},sidebar_class_name:"get api-method",info_path:"docs/greenfield-api/greenfield-grpc-gateway-docs",custom_edit_url:null},m=void 0,y={unversionedId:"greenfield-api/allowance",id:"greenfield-api/allowance",title:"Allowance returns fee granted to the grantee by the granter.",description:"Allowance returns fee granted to the grantee by the granter.",source:"@site/docs/greenfield-api/allowance.api.mdx",sourceDirName:"greenfield-api",slug:"/greenfield-api/allowance",permalink:"/opbnb-docs/docs/greenfield-api/allowance",draft:!1,editUrl:null,tags:[],version:"current",frontMatter:{id:"allowance",title:"Allowance returns fee granted to the grantee by the granter.",description:"Allowance returns fee granted to the grantee by the granter.",sidebar_label:"Allowance",hide_title:!0,hide_table_of_contents:!0,api:{operationId:"Allowance",responses:{200:{description:"A successful response.",content:{"*/*":{schema:{type:"object",properties:{allowance:{description:"allowance is a allowance granted for grantee by granter.",type:"object",properties:{granter:{type:"string",description:"granter is the address of the user granting an allowance of their funds."},grantee:{type:"string",description:"grantee is the address of the user being granted an allowance of another user's funds."},allowance:{description:"allowance can be any of basic, periodic, allowed fee allowance.",type:"object",properties:{type_url:{type:"string",description:'A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message.
