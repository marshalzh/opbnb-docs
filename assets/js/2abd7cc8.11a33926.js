The\nmodus operandi of the resource manager is to restrict resource usage at the time of reservation. When a component of\nthe stack needs to use a resource, it reserves it in the appropriate scope. The resource manager gates the reservation\nagainst the scope applicable limits; if the limit is exceeded, then an error is up the component to act accordingly.\nAt the lower levels of the stack, this will normally signal a failure of some sorts, like failing to opening a connection,\nwhich will propagate to the programmer.
