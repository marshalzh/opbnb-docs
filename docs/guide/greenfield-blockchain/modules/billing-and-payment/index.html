<code>Stream</code> from users to the SPs at a constant rate. The fees are charged
every second as they are used.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concepts-and-formulas">Concepts and Formulas<a class="hash-link" href="#concepts-and-formulas" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Streaming is a constant by-the-second movement of funds from a sending
account to a receiving account. Instead of sending payment transactions
now and then, Greenfield records the static balance, the latest update
timestamp, and flow rate in its payment module, and calculates the
dynamic balance with a formula using this data in the records. If the
net flow rate is not zero, the dynamic balance will change as time
elapses.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="terminology">Terminology<a class="hash-link" href="#terminology" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Payment Module:</strong> This module is a special ledger system designed
to manage billing and payments on the Greenfield blockchain.
Funds will be deposited or charged into it from users&#x27; balance or
payment accounts via the Payment Module;</p></li><li><p><strong>Stream Account</strong>: The Payment Module has its own ledger for
billing management. Users can deposit and withdraw funds into
their corresponding &quot;accounts&quot; on the payment module ledger. These
accounts are called <code>Stream Account</code>, which will directly interact
with the stream payment functions and bill the users for the
storage and data service;</p></li><li><p><strong>Payment Account</strong>: Payment account has been discussed in other
sections of Part 1 and Part 3 already. It is actually a type of
Stream Account. Users can create different payment accounts and
associate it with different buckets for different purposes;</p></li><li><p><strong>Payment Stream:</strong> Whenever the users add, delete or change a storage
object or download a data package, they add or change one or more
<code>payment streams</code> for that service provided by SPs;</p></li><li><p><strong>Flow Rate</strong>: The per-second rate at which a sender decreases its
net outflow stream and increases a receiver&#x27;s net inflow stream
when creating or updating a payment stream;</p></li><li><p><strong>Netflow Rate</strong>: The per-second rate that an account&#x27;s balance is
changing. It is the sum of the account&#x27;s inbound and outbound
flow rates;</p></li><li><p><strong>Sender</strong>: The stream account that starts the payment stream by
specifying a receiver and a flow rate at which its net flow
decreases;</p></li><li><p><strong>Receiver</strong>: The stream account on the receiving end of one or more payment streams.</p></li><li><p><strong>CRUD Timestamp</strong>: The timestamp that indicates when a user
creates, updates, or deletes a payment stream;</p></li><li><p><strong>Delta Balance</strong>: The amount of the stream account&#x27;s balance that has
changed since the latest CRUD timestamp due to the flow. It can be
positive or negative;</p></li><li><p><strong>Static Balance</strong>: The balance of the stream account at the latest
CRUD timestamp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic Balance</strong>: The actual balance of a stream account. It is
the sum of the Static Balance and the Delta Balance.</p></li></ul><p>When a user&#x27;s stream account is initiated in the payment module by

module. The <code>StaticBalance</code> in the <code>StreamPayment</code> data struct will be
&quot;settled&quot; first: the <code>CRUDTimeStamp</code> will be updated and <code>StaticBalance</code>
will be netted with <code>DeltaBalance</code>. Then the deposit and withdrawal number
will try to add/reduce the <code>StaticBalance</code> in the record. If the static
balance is less than the withdrawal amount, the withdrawal will fail.</p><p>Deposit and withdrawal via cross-chain will also be supported to enable
users to deposit and withdraw from BSC directly.</p><p>Specifically, the payment deposit can be triggered automatically during
the creation of objects or the addition of data packages. As long as
users have assets in their address accounts and payment accounts, the
payment module may directly charge the users by moving the funds from
address accounts.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="payment-stream">Payment Stream<a class="hash-link" href="#payment-stream" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Payment streams are flowing in one direction. Whenever the users deposit
from their address accounts into the stream accounts (including users&#x27;
default stream account and created payment accounts), the funds first go
from the users&#x27; address accounts to a system account maintained by the
Payment Module, although the fund size and other payment parameters will
be recorded on the users&#x27; stream account, i.e. the <code>StreamPayment</code> record,
in the Payment Module ledger. When the payment is settled, the funds
will go from the system account to SPs&#x27; address accounts according to
their in-flow calculation.</p><p>Every time users do the actions below, their <code>StreamRecord</code> will
be updated:</p><ul><li><p>Creating an object will create new streams to the SPs;</p></li><li><p>Deleting an object will delete associated streams to the SPs;</p></li><li><p>Adjusting the read quota will
create/delete/update the associated streams.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="forced-settlement">Forced Settlement<a class="hash-link" href="#forced-settlement" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If a user doesn&#x27;t deposit for a long time, his previous deposit may be
all used up for the stored objects. Greenfield has a forced settlement
mechanism to ensure enough funds are secured for further service fees.</p><p>There are two configurations, <code>ReserveTime</code> and <code>ForcedSettleTime</code>. </p><p>Let&#x27;s take an example where the <code>ReserveTime</code> is 7 days and the <code>ForcedSettleTime</code> is 1 day.
If a user wants to store an object at the price of
approximately $0.1 per month($0.00000004/second), he must reserve fees
for 7 days in the buffer balance, which is <code>$0.00000004 * 7 * 86400 =
$0.024192</code>. If the user deposits is $1 initially, the stream payment
record will be as below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>CRUD Timestamp</strong>: 100;</p></li><li><p><strong>Static Balance</strong>: $0.975808;</p></li><li><p><strong>Netflow Rate</strong>: -$0.00000004/sec;</p></li><li><p><strong>Buffer Balance</strong>: $0.024192.</p></li></ul><p>After 10000 seconds, the dynamic balance of the user will be <code>0.975808 - 10000 * 0.00000004 = 0.975408</code>.</p><p>After 24395200 seconds(approximately 282 days), the dynamic balance of
the user will become negative. Users should have some alarms for such
events that remind them to supply more funds in time.</p><p>If no more funds are supplied and the dynamic balance plus buffer
balance is under the forced settlement threshold, the account will be
forcibly settled. All payment streams of the account will be closed and
the account will be marked as out of balance. The download speed for all
objects associated with the account or payment account will be
downgraded. The objects will be deleted by the SPs if no fund is
provided within the predefined threshold.</p><p>The forced settlement will also charge some fees which is another
incentive for users to replenish funds proactively.</p><p>Let&#x27;s say the <code>ForceSettlementTime</code> variable is set to 1 day. After 24913601
seconds(approximately 288 days), the dynamic balance becomes <code>0.975808 -
24913601 *0.00000004 = -0.02073604</code>, plus the buffer balance is
$0.00345596. The forced settlement threshold is <code>86400* 0.00000004 =
0.003456</code>. The forced settlement will be triggered, and the record of the
user will become as below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>CRUD Timestamp</strong>: 24913701;</p></li><li><p><strong>Static Balance</strong>: \$0;</p></li><li><p><strong>Netflow Rate</strong>: \$0/sec;</p></li><li><p><strong>Buffer Balance</strong>: \$0.</p></li></ul><p>The validators will get the remaining $0.00345596 as a reward. The
account will be marked as &quot;frozen&quot; and his objects get downgraded
by SPs.</p><p>Every time a stream record is updated, Greenfield calculates the time
when the account will be out of balance. So Greenfield can keep an
on-chain list to trace the timestamps for the potential forced
settlement. The list will be checked by the end of every block
processing. When the block time passes the forced settlement timestamp,
the settlement of the associated stream accounts will be triggered
automatically.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="payment-account">Payment Account<a class="hash-link" href="#payment-account" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Payment account is a special &quot;Stream Account&quot; type in the Payment
Module. Users can create multiple payment accounts and have the
permission to link buckets to different payment accounts to pay for
storage and data package.</p><p>The payment accounts have the below traits:</p><ul><li><p>Every user can create multiple payment accounts. The payment
accounts created by the user are recorded with a map on the
Greenfield blockchain.</p></li><li><p>The address format of the payment account is the same as normal
accounts. It&#x27;s derived by the hash of the user address and
payment account index. The payment account only exists in the
storage payment module. Users can deposit into, withdraw from and
query the balance of payment accounts in the payment module, which
means payment accounts cannot be used for transfer or staking.</p></li><li><p>Users can only associate their buckets with their payment accounts
to pay for storage and bandwidth. Users cannot associate their own
buckets with others&#x27; payment accounts, and users cannot associate
others&#x27; buckets with their own payment accounts.</p></li><li><p>The owner of a payment account is the user who creates it. The owner
can set it non-refundable. It&#x27;s a one-way setting and can not be
revoked. Thus, users can set some objects as &quot;public goods&quot; which
can receive donations for storage and bandwidth while preserving
the ownership.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="account-freeze-and-resume">Account Freeze and Resume<a class="hash-link" href="#account-freeze-and-resume" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If a payment account is out of balance, it will be settled and set a
flag as out of balance.</p><p>The <code>NetflowRate</code> will be set to 0, while the current settings of the
stream pay will be backed up in another data structure. The download
speed for all objects under this account will be downgraded.</p><p>If someone deposits BNB tokens into a frozen account and the static balance is
enough for reserved fees, the account will be resumed automatically. The
stream pay will be recovered from the backup.</p><p>During the <code>OutOfBalance</code> period, no objects can be associated with this
payment account again, which results in no object can be created under
the bucket associated with the account.</p><p>If the associated object is deleted, the backup stream pay settings will
be changed accordingly to ensure it reflects the latest once the account
is resumed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="storage-fee-price-and-adjustment">Storage Fee Price and Adjustment<a class="hash-link" href="#storage-fee-price-and-adjustment" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The storage fee prices are determined by the SPs who supply the storage service.
The cost of the SPs are composed of 3 parts:</p><ul><li>The primary SP will store the whole object file;</li><li>The secondary SPs will store part of the object file as a replica;</li><li>The primary SP will supply all the download requests of the object.</li></ul><p>There are 3 different on-chain prices:</p><ul><li>Primary SP Store Price;</li><li>Primary SP Read Price;</li><li>Secondary SP Store Price.</li></ul><p>Every SP can set their own store price and read price via on-chain transactions.
While the secondary SP store price is calculated by averaging all SPs&#x27; store price.</p><p>The unit of price is a decimal, which indicates wei BNB per byte per second.
E.g. the price is 0.027, means approximately $0.022 / GB / Month.
(<code>0.027 * (30 * 86400) * (1024 * 1024 * 1024) * 300 / 10 ** 18 ≈ 0.022</code>, assume the BNB price is 300 USD) </p><p>The storage fees are calculated and charged in bucket level.
The store price and read price is up to the SP of bucket.
The secondary store price is stored in the chain state and the same for all buckets.
The total size of all objects and per secondary SP served size in a bucket will be recorded in the bucket metadata.
The charge size will be used instead of the real size, e.g. files under 1KB will be charged as 1KB to cover the cost.
The payment bill will be calculated by the size statistics and prices, and it will be charged from
the stream account specified in the bucket to the SPs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="payment-states">Payment States<a class="hash-link" href="#payment-states" title="Direct
